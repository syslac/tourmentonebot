== TourmentoneBot ==

Simple Telegram bot (in Python) to help keep track of upcoming concerts.

=== Features ===

 * /add command, to add new event; mandatory format is /add yyyy-mm-dd Artist@Venue
 * /next command, to show the first 5 upcoming events
 * Automatic reminder of shows within the same week, and on the same day of the event
 * Records chat info, so should be okay to use personally and in one or more group chats, without confusion

Can potentially obviously be used for deadlines not related to music

=== Backend ===
Simple sqlite table named `shows`, with schema (id PRIMARY, artist text, date text, place text, notified_week int, notified_day int, chat_id text)
